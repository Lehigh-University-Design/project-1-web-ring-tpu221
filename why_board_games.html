      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Why Board Games?</h2>
      <p style="text-align:center;">
Board games are fun and important because they bring people together in a way that few other activities can. At their core, board games blend competition, strategy, and creativity, offering entertainment that is both mentally engaging and socially rewarding. Unlike passive forms of entertainment, board games require active participation, decision-making, and interaction, which makes the experience more memorable.

One of their greatest strengths is immersion. Many board games allow players to step into fantasy worlds—whether it’s exploring dungeons, building civilizations, or surviving in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The combination of physical components, shared storytelling, and imagination creates a sense of presence that feels different from just watching a screen. Rolling dice, moving pieces, or drawing cards all add a tactile element that deepens immersion and makes the world feel “real” in your hands.

Board games also encourage face-to-face connection, something increasingly rare in a world dominated by social media and video games. While digital platforms often leave people feeling drained or isolated, sitting around a table fosters laughter, conversation, and teamwork (or friendly rivalry). They are a healthier, more intentional way to spend time—building bonds and memories rather than just scrolling through feeds or zoning out in front of a console.
